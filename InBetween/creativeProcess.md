# Creative Process

This piece developed from an idea that came about at the [Creative Dance and Technology Lab] (http://www.eastlondondance.org/projects/creative-dance-and-technology-lab-with-london-college-of-fashion/) 2017

Working in a small interdiciplinary group we discussed many ways of using each of our unique skills to make something for live performance. We had a mutual interest in making something very large, something that can both be used as costume and set. We wanted to experiment with restricting the performers movements. 

Conceptually we very quickly became interested in [Hypnic Jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk) and the myth that this happens as our brain thinks
