# A score for Y


This piece was created at the [Choreographic Coding Lab](http://choreographiccoding.org/){:target="_blank"} 2017 in collaboration with Marcel Smit.

[Creative Process](creativeProcess.md) 

We decided to explore the possibilities around making an improvising non-human dancer. We decided that the best approach would be a software project. Our aim was to give the non-human dancer a score in the same way that a human dancer might have. Our score - Explore the Y axis. This piece is written in a C++ framework written by Marcel. It uses data from a kinect which is pushed through a genetic algorithm with a generative fitness function. The generative fitness function ensures that the software dancer will never reach the goal and so will always have something to work towards. Continually exploring.
