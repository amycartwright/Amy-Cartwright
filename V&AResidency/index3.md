# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

Deliverable's 
 * Giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
 * Run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
 * Run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.
 * A final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
 * An online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DIY robots you made.

### Proposal

I want to use these three months to further my research into non-human dancers. Working with abstract forms I will attempt to create agency for non-human dancers in the performance space. I will explore different methods of sensing other bodies in the space and different types of mechanical motion. Questions I am interested in:

* Does the non-human dancer need to use motion data or can the data be collected in some other way?
* How far can our perception of agency be stretched. Does more abstraction equal less agency?
* How important are other elements of a performance (music, setting, lighting etc..) in the quest for perforative agency for non-human performers?

A side project I am working on that may feed into this project. I am assembling a collection of simple sketches that demostrate algorithms that can be used in a choreographic process. Some of these are algorithms that can be taken away from the screen and translated into choreographic tasks. Others will remain on the screen and be used by dancers as guidence for creating movement.
