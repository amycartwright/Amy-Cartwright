# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

in term of "immaterial" things I was thinking you could contribute to the department by:
giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.

In terms of material things:
a final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
an online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DYI robots you made. This was konstantin's idea and I think it's great.
