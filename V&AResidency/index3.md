# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

in term of "immaterial" things I was thinking you could contribute to the department by:
giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.

In terms of material things:
a final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
an online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DYI robots you made. This was konstantin's idea and I think it's great.

### Feedback sessions

Explore the gap between using a potentiometer and computer vision. There is a difference. What is it? How can you show this? How can you demonstrate this? Open the crack wider. Exploring agency, when i use cv there is another person in the room with me. I can experiment ans find out what works what doesnt, what is suprising. the agency coming from the physical can be faked. Fine line - sit just below it. The software can fill any gaps in agency - So how the robot respons to the human. 

### Creative soup

And all the questionmarks started to sing

Next time to meet as a group - make a presentation. powerpoint. shows off projects. Like a kickstarter. or applying for funding. What you have now and what you plan on having.
