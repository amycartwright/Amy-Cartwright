# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

Deliverable's
 * Giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
 * Run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
 * Run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.
 * A final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
 * An online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DIY robots you made.

### Proposal

I want to use these three months to further my practical research into non-human dancers. Working with abstract robotic forms I will explore how to create agency for non-human dancers in a live performance space. I will explore different methods of sensing other bodies in the space and different types of mechanical motion. Questions I am interested in:

* Does the non-human dancer need to use motion data or can the data be collected in some other way?
* How far can our perception of agency be stretched. Does more abstraction equal less agency?
* How important are other elements of a performance (music, setting, lighting etc..) in the quest for perforative agency for non-human performers?
