# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

Deliverable's 
 * giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
 * run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
 * run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.
 * a final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
 * an online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DYI robots you made. This was konstantin's idea and I think it's great.


### Early Experiments

I am attracted o the motion of a piston as the extension it shows is not something that we see when observing movement in the human body. This is a level of extraction that I wanted to exlore. Is it too abstract? Does it still allow the audienct to look at it as a perofrmer or is the familiarity of type of movement essential? 
These questions are difficult to answer at this stage but I think are worth further exploration. Next steps for this prototype will include contructing a more solid physical form using aliminium tubing and 3D printing. I will then work on the software. Introduncting CV and running a series of tests to see how the movement of the human can effect the movement of this very simple 'part'. And even more important what the effect is on the onlooker when watching this 'part' moving alongside a human body in a shared space.

Why is it soimportant to me to use computer vision to control my prototypes? Explore the gap between using something like a potentiometer and computer vision. There is a difference. What is it? How can you show this? How can you demonstrate this? Open the crack wider. Exploring agency, when i use cv there is another person in the room with me. I can experiment ans find out what works what doesnt, what is suprising. the agency coming from the physical can be faked. Fine line - sit just below it. The software can fill any gaps in agency - So how the robot respons to the human.
