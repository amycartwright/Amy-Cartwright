# V&A / Goldsmiths Residency

Deliverable's 
 * giving a talk at the end of your residency showing what you did / learned
 * run a workshop teaching students an aspect of what you have learned (say robotics)
 * run a couple of crit sessions with the MA/MFA students or possibly run a session on exhibition dos and dont's from last year's experience.
 * a final piece of tech you've developed, which will go on display in the V&A (and perhaps also here - TBC).
 * an online tutorial that could be used for teaching in the years to come... that's your legacy. If you made robots...  then a step-by-step tutorial hosted on gitlab perhaps (TBC) showing how to make these DYI robots you made.
